NB: No longer maintained

This repository provides an automation solution developed for network testing and monitoring of Exium’s xEdges using Linux-based CLI tools. The scripts automate connecting to each OCN (On-premises Cyber Node), running connectivity checks, and sending detailed results to a designated Slack channel.

Key Features
Connectivity Testing: Automatically connects to each xEdge to verify connectivity.
Endpoint Monitoring: Pings DNS and SPA endpoints to ensure service health.
Slack Integration: Shares results in real-time to a Slack channel.
Scalability: Supports testing for multiple xEdges and endpoints.
Usage
This tool is ideal for network engineers or system administrators seeking an automated solution for monitoring Exium’s xEdge connections and status, reducing manual effort and enabling rapid diagnostics.
